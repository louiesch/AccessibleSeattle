been researching resources to use for the "about" page. I really want to use this to not just create a social media, but also raise awareness about something I care a lot about and impacts people in my life.

currently doing research for what kinds of accessibility to include in this. I figured a few seeded posts would be good to get people started. So far: elevators, wheelchair accessibility, ASL. For schools: accomodations for tests and assignments, attendance. For parks: are there benches or other spots where people can stop and sit? Braille in buildings. Job accomodations in the workplace. 

since I have my login button, gonna try and get firebase to work now.

Collecting more resources. Specifically looking at this one for ideas: https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/14/what-disability-accessible-city-look-like

Keep trying to get the login button to actually work, but I'm running into one bug after another

I managed to sort of fix it after enough googling by deleting node_modules and package-lock,json, clearing npm cache and installing again. Also had to comment out firebase storage. Calling it quits for the night 

I can use google to log in!!! yay!!! But now I need conditional rendering to show the option to create a post if the user is signed in. I am also re-thinking my MVP and stretch goals, will update as needed
