## _Description_

Accessible Seattle is a social media platform for people with and friends/family of those with disabilities, neurodivergence, sensory processing disorders, and other special needs. Users can submit information about accessibility, accomodations, and potential sights, sounds, smells, etc in the local Seattle community.

## _About this Project and Further Reading_

* Why create this website?
  * My goal in creating this was to provide a resource for those whose needs are often left out of your average Google or Yelp review.

* Who can post?
  * Anyone! Although this was created for people with and family/friends of those with disabilities in mind, anyone is welcome to post and share their experiences.

* What kind of things should be posted?
  * Some examples: Is the location wheelchair accessible? Some issues could include stairs, revolving doors, cobbles, and steps. Were staff/employees accomodating? For those on the autism spectrum or with sensory processing disorders, are there any potential sights, sounds, or smells to report (very loud music, beeping from the restaurant kitchen, flourescent lighting, etc)?

---

## _Technologies Used_

* **eslint**
* **Git and GitHub**
* **Firebase/FireStore**
* **HTML5/CSS**
* **JavaScript ES6**
* **Node Package Manager**
* **React**
* **Visual Studio Code**
* **webpack**

(thats all FOR NOW)

---

## _Known Bugs_
* No known bugs at this time.

---

## _MVP_
* Users can view and post to a pubic feed.

* Let users create an account where they can set up a profile.

* Once a profile is set up, users can go back and edit or delete their posts.

* I want the website itself to be sensory-friendly, as such a light/dark mode toggle is needed at the very minimum. Will need to research some more about this part of the MVP

---

## _Stretch Goals_

* Incorporate an interactive crowd-sourced map of some kind. Users should be able to add pins to the map, leave comments/feedback on those pins, and also view the pins of other contributers.
  * For now, this is more of a stretch goal, because I have no idea how I would do this. However, I very much would like this to be a part of the website. If implemented successfully, this may even become the primary focus of the site, and the feed will become secondary/deleted altogether.

* Users can rate posts/pins by other users (a like button, or "this was helpful" type button basically)

* Users can leave comments on the posts/map pins of other users

## _Additional Instructions From the React Team_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
